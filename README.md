## 📖 About This Repository
This repository serves as a log of my learning progress as I work through **"Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition"** by Eric Matthes. 

It documents my journey transitioning into **Software Engineering** and mastering **Python Development**. It primarily contains my solutions to the chapter exercises, code snippets, and notes on core Python concepts. This is where I practice the fundamentals before applying them to larger builds.

## 🚀 Course Curriculum: Major Projects
The book's curriculum includes three major projects designed to apply the concepts learned in Part I. 

**Note:** To maintain clean version control and project structure, I am creating separate repositories for some of these distinct projects as I reach them in the curriculum.

* **Alien Invasion (Game Dev):** A 2D arcade-style shooter game built with Pygame.
* **Data Visualization (Data Science):** Generating interactive charts and graphs using Matplotlib and Plotly.
* **Learning Log (Web Dev):** A web application built with Django and Bootstrap.
